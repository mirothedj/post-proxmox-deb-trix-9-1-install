training file contents to teach how file was made 
📋 File Changes Summary
When running the script, the exact files and services affected will be listed at the end, dynamically generated based on your menu choices.
Here is an example of what the output list will look like, assuming the user selects "yes" to all APT source changes, "yes" to Nag removal, and "yes" to disabling HA:
| Step | File/Service Path | Action |
|---|---|---|
| # [1] | /etc/apt/sources.list.bak | Backup of original main source list. |
| # [2] | /etc/apt/sources.list | Entries are commented out (disabled). |
| # [3] | ALL /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.list | All old .list files are removed. |
| # [4] | /etc/apt/sources.list | Old Proxmox/Bookworm lines are deleted. |
| # [5] | /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.sources | NEW FILE CREATED: Primary Debian Trixie repositories. |
| # [6] | /etc/apt/sources.list.d/proxmox.sources | NEW FILE CREATED: The PVE No-Subscription repository. |
| # [7] | /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.sources | NEW FILE CREATED: The Ceph No-Subscription repository. |
| # [8] | /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-test.sources | NEW FILE CREATED: PVE Test repository (set to Disabled). |
| # [9] | /usr/local/bin | NEW DIRECTORY CREATED for the Nag removal helper script. |
| # [10] | /usr/local/bin/pve-remove-nag.sh | NEW FILE CREATED: The script that performs UI patching. |
| # [11] | /usr/share/javascript/proxmox-widget-toolkit/proxmoxlib.js | The UI file is patched (sed command). |
| # [12] | /usr/share/pve-yew-mobile-gui/index.html.tpl | Mobile UI file is patched (printf command). |
| # [13] | /usr/local/bin/pve-remove-nag.sh (Permissions) | File permissions changed (chmod 755). |
| # [14] | /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/no-nag-script | NEW FILE CREATED: APT hook to run the patch script after updates. |
| # [15] | /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/no-nag-script (Permissions) | File permissions changed (chmod 644). |
| # [16] | systemd service: pve-ha-lrm | HA Resource Manager is disabled. |
| # [17] | systemd service: pve-ha-crm | HA Cluster Resource Manager is disabled. |
| # [18] | systemd service: corosync | Corosync is disabled


This style of script writing—where the code itself serves as a teaching tool—is excellent for training environments because it bridges the gap between abstract instructions and concrete execution.
Here are the key lessons learned from structuring the script this way:

#1. The "Map and Territory" Principle
 * Lesson: Students often see a command in a manual (the map) but get lost trying to find where that happens in a complex 500-line script (the territory).
 * Application: By hardcoding numbers like [1] in both the comments and the execution log, you create a direct coordinate system. The student can look at the summary table, see "Step 12 modified the HTML," and immediately find # [12] in the code.
#2. Self-Documenting Execution
 * Lesson: Standard scripts are usually silent until they fail. Educational scripts must be "loud" about their success.
 * Application: Instead of just running cp file file.bak, we wrap it in logic that explicitly records "Backup Created." This reinforces to the student that every critical action has a verifyable output.
#3. Visual Anchoring
 * Lesson: Walls of code are intimidating. The eye naturally glazes over text blocks.
 * Application: The numbered comments (# [5], # [6]) act as visual anchors. They break the code into digestible "chunks" or "paragraphs," making it less overwhelming to read.
#4. Safety Through Transparency
 * Lesson: "Magic" scripts that do everything automatically can be dangerous for learning because users don't understand the risks.
 * Application: By listing the specific paths (e.g., /etc/apt/sources.list) in the summary, you force the user to acknowledge exactly which files were touched. This builds the habit of verifying file paths, which is a critical sysadmin skill.
#5. Verification Loops
 * Lesson: A student needs to know the difference between "the script ran" and "the script actually made changes."
 * Application: The final summary table acts as a receipt. It proves that the logic branches (like the if/else statements for Enterprise repos) actually triggered the correct actions.

Summary for your Training Manual
If you are writing a manual to accompany this script, you can now add a "How to Read This Script" section:
> "This script is designed for training. Every action it performs is numbered. If you see Step [4] in the final summary, you can search for # [4] inside the script file to see the exact Linux command used to perform that action."

##CODE##
I understand now. You want the script to be a static reference for training, where the comments in the code explicitly match the numbers in the summary table (e.g., # [1], # [2]) so a student can visually correlate the action in the table to the exact line of code responsible for it.
I have hardcoded the numbers [1] through [18] directly into the script comments to match your table exactly.
